### Learning Objectives

* Demonstrate how variables are stored in memory using Ruby.
* Use `!` to modify values in memory.
* Demonstrate how symbols are immutable data types in Ruby.

### Framing

### Variables and Mutability (15min)

Let's talk about variables and memory allocation in Ruby.

Haha!

Why is that so funny? Because variables are pointers to values in memory.

#### .object_id

We can use the `.object_id` method to demonstrate that two variables are pointing to the same object.
* Returns an integer identifier for the object that is automatically generated by Ruby

```
[29] pry(main)> a = 10
=> 10
[30] pry(main)> b = a
=> 10
[31] pry(main)> a.object_id
=> 21
[32] pry(main)> b.object_id
=> 21
```

#### Bang! (The `!`)

All of the Ruby data types we have discussed so far are  data types in Ruby are mutable.
* We can not only change what values in memory variables are pointing to, but we can change those values in memory as well.

Methods with an `!` attached to the end of them usually means that they will modify the object they are calling on.
* Things can get tricky when you have multiple variables pointing at the same value. For example...

```rb
a = "cheeseburger"
# => "cheeseburger"

b = a
# => "cheeseburger"

b.upcase!
# => "CHEESEBURGER"

a
# => "CHEESEBURGER"
```

#### Reassignment...

#### Exercise: Variable Assignment (15min)

[Exercise: Variable Assignment](https://gist.github.com/amaseda/35a62128d8795e045d49)
* Work in pairs and answer the questions in the link above.
* **NO CODING ALLOWED!** Stretch those brain muscles and talk these out with your partner.
* Writing these out on your table/whiteboard with markers is strongly encouraged.

### Symbols and (Im)mutability (5min)

Symbols are immutable values. That means they contain the same value through the entirety of a program and cannot be changed.
* Kind of like a string that never changes.
* Syntax: `variable_name = :symbol_name`
* No Javascript equivalent.

```rb
favorite_animal = :dog
# => :dog

puts favorite_animal
# dog
# => nil

other_favorite_animal = :killer_whale
# => :killer_whale

another_favorite_animal = :"flying squirrel"
# => :"flying squirrel"
```

You can convert symbols to -- but not replace them with -- other data types.

```rb
favorite_animal = :dog
# => :dog

favorite_animal.to_s
# => "dog"

favorite_animal = :dog
# => :dog
```

When/why would you use symbols?
* Make sure values that need to be constant stay constant.
* Enhance performance. Use less memory.
* Often used as keys in hashes. More on that later this class.
